<p>So <code>whoami</code>? Well, I am an engineer, a computer science engineer &#8230; a super passionate computer science engineer. Ok that&#8217;s how I like it.</p>

<p>I have a lot of sensibility regarding the theme of ethic software development. What I consider as &#8220;ethic&#8221; is using <em>Open Source</em> licenses. I love using and developing Open Source software.</p>

<p>In the future I would like to have a <strong>positive impact on the world</strong>.</p>

<p>I am <strong>nostalgic</strong> of the period from the 80s to the 2000s even though I was born in the late 2002. That&#8217;s why this website looks ugly, I wanted it to have a <em>classic look</em>. I think it is really cool. Plus I don&#8217;t think that complexity (as we are often used to see) in such a case is needed. And for the most of its functionality it does not use javascript. So I am sure a <em>MAC SE/30</em> would have no problem at all rendering it.</p>
<p>end.</p>
