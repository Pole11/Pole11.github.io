So `whoami`? Well, I am an engineer, a computer science engineer ... a super passionate computer science engineer. Ok that's how I like it.

I have a lot of sensibility regarding the theme of ethic software development. What I consider as "ethic" is using *Open Source* licenses. I love using and developing Open Source software.

In the future I would like to have a **positive impact on the world**.

I am **nostalgic** of the period from the 80s to the 2000s even though I was born in the late 2002. That's why this website looks ugly, I wanted it to have a *classic look*. I think it is really cool. Plus I don't think that complexity (as we are often used to see) in such a case is needed. And for the most of its functionality it does not use javascript. So I am sure a *MAC SE/30* would have no problem at all rendering it.
